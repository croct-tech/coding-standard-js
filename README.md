## Installation

The recommended way to install the SDK is via [NPM](https://npmjs.com). It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as
Webpack or Browserify:

```sh
npm i -D @croct/eslint-plugin
```

Then, add the following to your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```js
// This is needed to avoid adding the transitive ESLint dependencies of the plugin to the project
require("@rushstack/eslint-patch/modern-module-resolution");

module.exports = {
   "plugins": ["@croct"]
}
```

Note the `require` call at the top of the file. This is a workaround to avoid adding the transitive dependencies of 
the plugin to the project, which is [currently not supported by the ESLint plugin system](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458).

For TypeScript projects, there are a few more steps. 

First, you need to install the TypeScript parser:

```sh
npm i -D @typescript-eslint/parser
```

Then, add the following to your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```js
require("@rushstack/eslint-patch/modern-module-resolution");

module.exports = {
    "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    "plugins": [
      "@croct"
    ],
    "extends": [
      "plugin:@croct/typescript"
    ],
    "parserOptions": {
      "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
      "project": ["./tsconfig.json"]
    },
}
```

For the list for available presets and rules, see the [reference documentation](docs/README.md). 

## Basic usage

Run the following command to check if the project adheres to the coding standard:

```sh
eslint
```
